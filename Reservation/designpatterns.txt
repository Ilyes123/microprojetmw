Used design patterns:
    1. Synchronous calls: The calls for the methods on the managers are all synchronous.
    2. Interface contract between clients and servers: The clients only have access to the interfaces provided by the servers.
    3. Wrapper: We used a wrapper class to convert the rest calls to method calls on the MailBoxManager.
    4. Naming: The servers register their names and the clients retrieve a reference on them by providing that name.
